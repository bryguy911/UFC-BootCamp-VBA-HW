In this hw 2
I  was able to take a set of data and collect the data from all the sheets of the workbooks, calculate the the changes quarterly,Precent, and total stock volume.
I was able to use conditional formating to make the quarterly change >0 to turn green and <0 to turn red, while leaving those at 0 stay white.
I was then able to take my table and calculate the greatest precent increase , decrease and greatest total volume out of all the data collected in the first data table I created.
